Docker Multi-Stage Build Demonstration
This repository contains example Dockerfiles to demonstrate the benefits of multi-stage builds in creating smaller, more efficient Docker images. We will compare a standard build process with a multi-stage approach, focusing on the final image size.

Learning Objectives
By working through this example, you will learn:

How to build Docker images from a Dockerfile.
The impact of build artifacts on final image size.
What multi-stage builds are and how to implement them.
The advantages of multi-stage builds for production deployments.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:

Docker Desktop (for macOS/Windows) or Docker Engine (for Linux) installed and running on your machine.
Basic understanding of Docker concepts (images, containers, Dockerfiles).

Dockerfile: Represents a "traditional" Dockerfile that includes all build dependencies in the final image.
Dockerfile-withstaging: Demonstrates a multi-stage build, separating build-time dependencies from the final runtime image.
Building the Images
We will build several images to compare their sizes.

Build a "No Stage" Image (Alpine-based)
This image uses a standard Dockerfile to build an application on an Alpine base image. It includes all build tools and dependencies in the final image.

docker build -t test-no-stage-alpine .

Build a "No Stage" Image (Debian-based)
Similar to the above, but using a larger Debian-based image to highlight the potential for bloat.

docker build -t test-no-stage .

Build a "With Stage" Image (Alpine-based)
This command uses the Dockerfile-withstaging file, which implements a multi-stage build. Notice the -f flag to specify an alternative Dockerfile name. This build separates the build environment from the final runtime environment.

docker build -t test-with-stage-alpine -f Dockerfile-withstaging .

Comparing Image Sizes
After building the images, let's examine their sizes to understand the impact of multi-stage builds.

Use the following command to list your Docker images and filter for the ones we just built:

docker images | grep 'test-'

Expected Output (example - actual sizes may vary):

REPOSITORY                  TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
test-no-stage-alpine        latest              <some_id_1>         X minutes ago       ~50MB
test-no-stage               latest              <some_id_2>         X minutes ago       ~200MB
test-with-stage-alpine      latest              <some_id_3>         X minutes ago       ~10MB
Discussion Points:
test-no-stage vs. test-no-stage-alpine: Observe the size difference due to the base image chosen (Debian vs. Alpine). Alpine is a much smaller base image.
test-no-stage-alpine vs. test-with-stage-alpine: This is where the power of multi-stage builds becomes evident. Even starting with a small Alpine base, the "no-stage" version includes build tools and intermediate files that significantly increase its size compared to the multi-stage version, which only copies the final, compiled artifact.
Why Multi-Stage Builds Matter
Smaller Image Sizes: Reduces the attack surface, download times, and storage requirements.
Improved Security: Less software in the final image means fewer vulnerabilities.
Faster Deployment: Smaller images transfer and start faster.
Cleaner Images: The final image contains only what's absolutely necessary for runtime.
Simplified Dockerfiles: While seemingly more complex at first, they allow for a clearer separation of concerns between build and runtime.
Conclusion
Multi-stage builds are a best practice for building efficient and secure Docker images, especially for compiled languages or applications with many build-time dependencies. By leveraging them, you can significantly optimize your containerized applications.
